This project has three small Python challenges that helped me practice loops.

Challenge 1: Collatz Sequence
This uses a while loop because we donâ€™t know how many steps it takes for the number to reach 1. 
A while loop works best when the number of repeats is not known ahead of time. 
The loop keeps running until the number equals 1.

Challenge 2: Prime Checker
This uses a for loop because we know what numbers we need to test from 2 up to n-1. 
A for loop is good when the range of numbers is known. 
This checks each number one at a time to decide if the number is prime or not.

Challenge 3: Multiplication Table
This uses nested for loops because the table is two dimensional. 
The outer loop goes through each row from 1 to 10. 
The inner loop goes through each column from 1 to 10. 
Together they print a grid where each product is in the right spot.
