This assignment has 3 challenges that helped me practice different types of loops in Python.

## Challenge 1 – Collatz Sequence 
I used a while loop because we don’t know how many steps it will take for the number to reach 1.  
A while loop is best when the number of repeats is unknown ahead of time.  
The program keeps running until the condition (number != 1) is no longer true.

## Challenge 2 – Prime Checker 
I used a **for loop** because we know exactly what numbers we need to test: from 2 up to n-1.  
A for loop is best when the range of numbers is known.  
The loop checks divisors one at a time and then decides if the number is prime or not.

## Challenge 3 – Multiplication Table 
I used nested for loops because the table is two-dimensional.  
The outer loop goes through each row (1–10), and the inner loop goes through each column (1–10).  
This lets us print a grid where every product is shown in the right spot.
